## üëã Introduction

An app that keeps you updatad with the live score of games occuring in your college.

In [Foss Overflow 2022](https://fossoverflow.dev/), I contributed to [Live Score App](https://github.com/OpenLake/Live-Score-App). 

Ever felt clueless to the games occuring in your college? Well not any more now you can view the scores of your/other college **live**, as well as take a look at previous games that occured in your college too.
You can also choose to be notified for the announcements from your college regarding future games. 
Along the way I faced alot of issues but with the kind guidance of the mentors [Nishant](https://github.com/M-A-D-A-R-A) and [Sakshi](https://github.com/Sakshisaraswat23), I was able to overcome most of them , and make Live Score a better app.

## üéâ Achievements

I got to learn so much from this event .

I learnt and improved various things along the project like:

- Firebase Realtime DataBase
- Firebase FireStore
- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Messaging and Notifications
- Run and Debug VSCode
- Material Designs , and many more.

## üìù My Contributions

- Ongoing Games Screen that shows live score and highlights
- Previous Games Screen that shows previous games score, highlights and winner
- Announcements Screen that shows all the notification and one can choose to subscribe to particular college notifications also
- Login and Signup Screen to authenticate user before letting them create games
- Admin Screen where user can create game, change score, write highlights, end game and choose the winner. They can also give notification to viewers about future games

## ‚ú® Experience
I learnt a lot of new things in flutter and now I feel more confident in making full fledged apps and I will keep contributing to Open Source appsüòä
